## Description

This is my first fully functional game built with Godot. I made it by following the very popular Brackeys YouTube tutorial series for Godot. The project is a learning exercise — it recreates the mechanics demonstrated in the video and includes my own small tweaks and polish as I learned.

## What this repository contains

- `game/` — game executable
- `README.md` — this file (project overview and instructions).
- other come from the Godot project folder (contains `project.godot`, scenes, scripts, assets, etc.).

## How to open and run

1. Open Godot (if not working move the README.md file and game/ folder somewhere else as they are not part of the Godot files).
2. Run the main scene from the Godot editor.


## Credits
