# First Godot Game

This is my first fully functional game built with Godot. I made it by following the very popular Brackeys YouTube tutorial series for Godot. The project is a learning exercise — it recreates the mechanics demonstrated in the video and includes my own small tweaks and polish as I learned.

## What this repository contains

- `game/` — game executable
- `README.md` — this file (project overview and instructions).
- other come from the Godot project folder (contains `project.godot`, scenes, scripts, assets, etc.).

## How to open and run

1. Open Godot (if not working move the README.md file and game/ folder somewhere else as they are not part of the Godot files).
2. Run the main scene from the Godot editor.

## Credits

- Project tutorial and guidance: Brackeys (YouTube).

## License

This is a personal learning project. Use the code and assets here for learning and experimentation. If you plan to reuse or redistribute assets, please check and respect any original asset licenses and the Brackeys tutorial guidance.
